I would like to say thank to my supervisors Joseph Morlier and Joan Mas Colomer for the extraordinary support, technical advise and for giving me the opportunity to join their project and to join their amazing research group. They was always ready to help with clarification, allowing me to acquire knowledge. Thanks to their support I was able to grow and improve my technical knowledge. I want to say thank also to the ISAE SUPAREO, and Institut Cl√©ment Ader to guest me in this period in Toulouse.\\
My thanks also go to professor Enrico Cestino and Giacomo Frulla and Ing. Claudia Bruni, to give me the possibility to participate to this project and for the support I've had every time I've asked for it.\\
I have to say thanks also to all the extraordinary people that i meet during the university experience, for the nice time that we spent together, for the mutual assistance throughout university period and for the friendship born from this.\\
Special thanks also go to the friends I met in Toulouse, for making this experience perfect and  for the extraordinary friendship that was born and that did not stop when returned.\\
